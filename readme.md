# Alfonso's bot connected with LUIS

## The LUIS app
Alfonso created a [LUIS app](https://www.luis.ai/) very simple, with only two intents: "Greet" and "Help".

Just following these instructions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/LUIS/luis-get-started-create-app 

We learned concepts as intents, utterances and entities.
